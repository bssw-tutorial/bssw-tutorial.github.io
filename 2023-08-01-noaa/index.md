# A typical initial tutorial page might include:
#         [description,agenda,presentation-slides,requested-citation,acknowledgments]
# Note that agenda, presentation-slides, and requested-citation are okay here because they
# gracefully handle the absence of the information required to make those sections "event-ready".
#
# A typical complete tutorial page would include: 
#         [description,agenda,presentation-slides,how-to-participate,hands-on-exercises,stay-in-touch,resources-from-presentations,requested-citation,acknowledgments]
# Consider adding a related-events section if appropriate
