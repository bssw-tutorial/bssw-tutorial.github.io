We gave a [full-day version of this tutorial](https://extremecomputingtraining.anl.gov/agenda-2020/#Track-7) for the [Argonne Extreme Scale Training Program](https://extremecomputingtraining.anl.gov/) (ATPESC) in August 2020.  The presentations slides are available at <https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.12719834>.  If you want to delve a little deeper into some of the topics we're covering, consider checking out these resources.  We want to particularly draw attention to Module 09 Reproducibility, which we were able to spend 45 minutes on, rather than 15 minutes today. Eventually, they will post recordings of all of the sessions.  If you'd like us to notify you when the videos are published, please email us at <bssw-tutorial@lists.mcs.anl.gov>.
