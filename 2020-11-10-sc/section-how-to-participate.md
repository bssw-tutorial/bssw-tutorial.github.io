{% assign headings = headings | push: "How To Participate" %}

* [Registration](https://sc20.supercomputing.org/attend/register/) for the tutorial program ("TUT") is required.  You can register at any time up to 16 December 2020 to get access to the recorded version of the tutorial for up to 6 months.

* Most presentations have been pre-recorded, though there are several live sessions interspersed.

* Please use the **question** tool to ask questions *at any time*. The speaker and the rest of the tutorial team will be monitoring and will respond.  If you're also interested in a question, feel free to add points to make it more visible to the tutorial team.  There is also a **chat** channel, which can be used for extended follow-up discussions.

* The schedule includes a break in the middle, where we plan to do more Q&A and if there is interest, some demos from the hands-on exercises.  There is also a segment at the end for additional Q&A and demos.

* Participation in the Q&A and demonstrations is optional â€“ we know you need breaks too.

* **Your feedback is important both to us and to the SC20 organizers.  Please remember to [evaluate us](https://submissions.supercomputing.org/?page=Submit&id=TutorialEvaluation&site=sc20)!** of follow the Evaluation link in the tutorial's page on the EventScribe site.  Evaluations can be submitted through 20 December 2020.

* **You might also be interested in attending these other ["software-related" events at SC20](https://bssw.io/events/sc20-software-related-events).**
