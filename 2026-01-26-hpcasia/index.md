# Generally, a complete tutorial page will include *one* of each of the following sections, in order:
#   description, agenda, presentation-slides, participate, related-events, stay-in-touch, resources-from-presentations, requested-citation, acknowledgments
#
# Notes
# - In most cases, the section files are found in the `_includes/section-*.md` files, though local files named `section-<section>.md` will be used preferentially if they exist.
# - The related-events section is optional, and usually used to provide information about related events or events of possible interest to the audience occurring at the
#   same venue.  By its nature, this section is normally included locally.
# - The default include files for most sections will degrade gracefully if all of the information they require is not yet available.  Therefore, it is safe to include nearly
#   all sections in the page from the start.
#   - An exception to this is the `resources-from-presentations` section. It is should only be added once the resource links have been updated for this tutorial.
# - Where multiple variants of the section appear in the list below, at most *one* of them should be uncommented
#
sections: 
  - description
  - agenda
  - presentation-slides
  - participate-inperson
  # - participate-hybrid
  # - participate-online
  # - related-events
  - stay-in-touch-no-ho
  # - resources-from-presentations

  # - acknowledgments-ecp
