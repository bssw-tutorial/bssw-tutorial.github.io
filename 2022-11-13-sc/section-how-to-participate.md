* As we will be in-person, please feel free to ask questions at any time.
* We will also be monitoring the #track-7-software Slack channel in case you don't want to interrupt the speaker.
* The schedule includes opportunities for extended Q&A/discussion both before and after dinner.  This is particularly useful if you'd like to go in-depth on a question or topic, or if you have experiences of your own you'd like to discuss.
