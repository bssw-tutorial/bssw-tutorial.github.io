  The accuracy and reliability of results produced by the scientific software depends not only on the individual components behaving correctly, but also on the validity of their interactions.

  Therefore, a rigorous software process is a critical requirement for scientific productivity using such software.

  However, most science teams struggle to find a good solution for themselves, partly due to lack of training and partly due to lack of resources within the team.

  This tutorial leverages the combined expertise of various IDEAS project members to provide a methodology for devising a software process that meets the needs of individual projects

# Add due dates where appropriate. Those without will be ignored
# Responsible refers to the (set of) github ids that will be assigned to
# generated issues. Usually these are organizer-ids, presenter-ids, or
