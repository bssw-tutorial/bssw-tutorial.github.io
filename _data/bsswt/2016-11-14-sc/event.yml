#   As soon as the doi is reserved, the doi status should be set to "reserved",

description: "Testing at various granularities has recently acquired an urgency in high-performance scientific computing communities because of the need for refactoring caused by changing platform architectures. Projects that need to refactor are often lacking in the necessary expertise and resources to acquire such expertise. Testing is also critical for producing credible results and for code maintenance. The IDEAS (<https://ideas-productivity.org>) scientific software productivity project aims toward increasing software productivity and sustainability with participants from many projects that define the state of practice in software engineering in the HPC community. We offer a tutorial that distills the combined knowledge of IDEAS team members in the area of scientific software testing. The tutorial will be useful to all projects that recognize the importance of testing in general and will provide tremendous help to projects in need of refactoring their software in particular."
