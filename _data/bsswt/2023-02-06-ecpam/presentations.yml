# This file should be thought of as "cumulative".
# It reflects all presentation in the repo at any moment, regardless of
# whether we're using them in a given tutorial.
#
# This file is used in the website to map the presentation shorthands
# (the filenames) to the full titles.
# The website machinery simply takes the presentation shorthand as it
# encounters it in the agenda, and looks up in presentations.yml
# what the full title is.
#
# Here are the rules for changing presentations.yml:
# - If you change the title of the presentation, update it here.
# - If you add a new presentation file to the repository, add a row below.
# - If we decide to retire a presentation file, its row gets removed.
#
# Case 3 will be rare and in most cases, there will be a period
# of overlap where we'll maintain multiple, fairly divergent
# versions of a presentation before retiring the original.
