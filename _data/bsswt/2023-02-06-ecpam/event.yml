  As many ECP projects begin their transition from major development towards production science, this tutorial will offer key strategies to help projects improve their science. The tutorial will focus on testing strategies (design and selection in different contexts), reproducibility concerns and the creation of “lab notebook”-style documentation. These practices will provide you and your team detailed information about what to do and why. We’ll offer practical strategies, based on experience in a broad range of projects, that can help improve the effectiveness in going from software to science.

# This is a standard collection of deadlines we've encountered historically
# Add due dates where appropriate. Those without will be ignored
# Responsible refers to the (set of) github ids that will be assigned to
# generated issues. Usually these are organizer-ids, presenter-ids, or
# helper-ids as set above.  "by-presentation" is a special value indicating
# that responsibilities should be assigned based on the presenters liseted
# in the agenda.
