* Please use Slack to ask questions at any time.  We will respond in chat or verbally as opportunities permit.  We'll call for questions at transition points in presentations, as time permits.

* During breaks, the instructors are happy to hold further discussions with anyone interested.

* The agenda includes a Q&A session at the end of the day as well.
