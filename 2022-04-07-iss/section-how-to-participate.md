* Please use Zoom chat or unmute to ask questions at any time.  We will respond in chat or verbally as opportunities permit.
* We will be available during the break for Q&A or further discussion.

* We have an afternoon session for the tutorial which will allow you to try the hands-on activities, ask questions from the presentations or have discussion of experiences and challenges with software development faced by participants in their own projects.
