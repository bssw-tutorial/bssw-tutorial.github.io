# Presentation Resources Directory

The files in this folder contain the resources (links) mentioned in the presentation slides, extracted here for convenience of access.

Each presentation has a separate file, named with the shorthand label for the presentation.

The overall structure is an unordered Markdown list, with the presentation titles as the first level.  Those first-level items are generated by the parent that includes these files.  Each file here starts with an HTML comment as a placeholder for that first level item.  The files themselves contain the second (and higher) levels of the list structure, and must be intended appropriately.

The expectation is that these resource files will be included in the order of the presentations according to the agenda.  There must be a file for every presentation.  If a presentation contains no resources, it should contain a single second-level item "`  * *none*`".
