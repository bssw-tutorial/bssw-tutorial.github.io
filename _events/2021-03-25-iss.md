## Description

Producing scientific software is a challenge.  The high-performance modeling and simulation community, in particular, is dealing with the confluence of disruptive changes in computing architectures and new opportunities (and demands) for greatly improved simulation capabilities, especially through coupling physics and scales.  At the same time, computational science and engineering (CSE), as well as other areas of science, are experiencing increasing focus on scientific reproducibility and software quality.

Computer architecture changes require new software design and implementation strategies, including significant refactoring of existing code. Reproducibility demands require more rigor across the entire software endeavor. Code coupling requires aggregate team interactions including integration of software processes and practices.  These challenges demand large investments in scientific software development and improved practices.  Focusing on improved developer productivity and software sustainability is both urgent and essential.

This half-day tutorial distills multi-project and multi-years experience from members of the IDEAS Productivity project and the creators of the BSSw.io community website. The tutorial will provide information about software practices, processes, and tools explicitly tailored for CSE. Topics to be covered include: Agile methodologies and tools, software design and refactoring, testing and continuous integration, Git workflows for teams, and reproducibility. Material will be mostly at the beginner and intermediate levels. There will also be opportunities to discuss topics raised by the audience.

  - Note that these files may include additional slides that will not be discussed during the tutorial, but questions are welcome.

* Errata:
  - v2: Corrects a small misstatement about doing demos during breaks in the tutorial
  - v1: Provided to ISS organizers

## Hands-On Exercises

### Introduction

The hands-on exercises for this {{ page.title-type }} are based around a simple numerical model using the one-dimensional heat equation.  The example is described briefly in the repository's [README]({{ site.github-url }}/{{ page.hands-on-repo }}#readme) file, and in greater detail in the ATPESC [Hands-On lesson](https://xsdk-project.github.io/MathPackagesTraining2020/lessons/hand_coded_heat/).  The ATPESC version focuses on the numerical aspects of the model.  But for this {{ page.title-type }}, we're focused on how to make the software better from a quality perspective, so **you don't need to understand the math to do these exercises**.

For the purposes of these hands-on exercises, you should imagine you've inherited an early version of the hello-numerical-world software from a colleague who's left the project, and you've been assigned to get it into better shape so that it can be used in the next [ATPESC](https://extremecomputingtraining.anl.gov/) summer school.

The repository you'll be working with is on GitHub: **[{{ page.hands-on-repo }}]({{ site.github-url }}/{{ page.hands-on-repo }})**.
*Note: most of the screenshots will refer to the generic "hello-numerical-world" repository rather than the one specifically for this tutorial.*

### List of Hands-On Exercises
*Note that the exercise numbers align with the presentation modules.  Not every module has exercises (yet).*
* **[Exercise 0: Setting up the Prerequisites](../{{ page.directory }}/handson-m00-prerequisites.html)**. Setup the accounts needed for these exercises.
* **[Exercise 2: Agile Methodologies](../{{ page.directory }}/handson-m02-agile.html).**  You'll use GitHub issues and project boards to setup a simple "personal kanban" board.
* **[Exercise 3: Git Workflows](../{{ page.directory }}/handson-m03-git-workflows.html).** You'll fork our hello-numerical-world repository, create a feature branch, and make a pull request
* **[Exercise 7a: Agile Redux](../{{ page.directory }}/handson-m07a-agile-redux.html).**  You'll create epic, story, and task issues for the refactoring task and track them on a kanban board
* **[Exercise 7b: Refactoring Part 1](../{{ page.directory }}/handson-m07b-refactoring1.html).**  You'll perform a small, well-defined refactoring exercise
* **[Exercise 7c: Refactoring Part 2](../{{ page.directory }}/handson-m07c-refactoring2.html).**  You'll perform a a more open-ended refactoring exercise
* **[Additional Exercise: Continuous Integration](../{{ page.directory }}/handson-m08-continuous-integration.html).** You'll establish a simple continuous integration workflow and then refine it, adding code coverage assessment
