## Hands-On Exercises

*In this tutorial, we will not have time set aside to work through the hands-on activities, but you are encouraged to pursue them on your own.  We'll watch the repository for issues and pull requests, and the mailing list for other questions, and provide feedback as we can.*

### Introduction

The hands-on exercises for this {{ page.title-type }} are based around a simple numerical model using the one-dimensional heat equation.  The example is described briefly in the repository's [README]({{ site.github-url }}/{{ hands-on-repo }}#readme) file, and in greater detail in the ATPESC [Hands-On lesson](https://xsdk-project.github.io/MathPackagesTraining2020/lessons/hand_coded_heat/).  The ATPESC version focuses on the numerical aspects of the model.  But for this {{ page.title-type }}, we're focused on how to make the software better from a quality perspective, so **you don't need to understand the math to do these exercises**.

For the purposes of these hands-on exercises, you should imagine you've inherited an early version of the hello-numerical-world software from a colleague who's left the project, and you've been assigned to get it into better shape so that it can be used in the next [ATPESC](https://extremecomputingtraining.anl.gov/) summer school.

The repository you'll be working with is on GitHub: **[{{ hands-on-repo }}]({{ site.github-url }}/{{ hands-on-repo }})**.
*Note: most of the screenshots will refer to the generic "hello-numerical-world" repository rather than the one specifically for this tutorial.*

### List of Hands-On Exercises
*Note that the exercise numbers align with the presentation modules.  Not every module has exercises (yet).*
  * **[Exercise 0: Setting up the Prerequisites](../{{ page.directory }}/handson-m00-prerequisites.html)**. Setup the accounts needed for these exercises.
  * **[Exercise 2: Agile Methodologies](../{{ page.directory }}/handson-m02-agile.html).**  You'll use GitHub issues and project boards to setup a simple "personal kanban" board.
  * **[Exercise 3: Git Workflows](../{{ page.directory }}/handson-m03-git-workflows.html).** You'll fork our hello-numerical-world repository, create a feature branch, and make a pull request
  * **[Exercise 6: Agile Redux](../{{ page.directory }}/handson-m06-agile-redux.html).**  You'll create epic, story, and task issues for the refactoring task and track them on a kanban board
  * **[Exercise 8: Software Testing](../{{ page.directory }}/handson-m08-testing.html).** You'll establish a simple continuous integration workflow and then refine it, adding code coverage assessment
  * **[Exercise 10: Continuous Integration](../{{ page.directory }}/handson-m10-continuous-integration.html).** You'll establish a simple continuous integration workflow and then refine it, adding code coverage assessment
  * **[Exercise 11: Refactoring Scientific Software](../{{ page.directory }}/handson-m11-refactoring1.html).**  You'll perform a small, well-defined refactoring exercise
