    emit-plural: Emit the plural of the given text based on the given count

    arguments:
        `text`: the string to be pluralized
        `count`: the number on which to based the pluralization

    Note: Assume plural is made by adding 's' at the end.  Some words may require a more general algorithm
    See https://github.com/bdesham/pluralize as an example of how to handle.
    P.S. The problems with bdesham's filter is that it emits the count and the text.  We want
    just the text.  Also, it is not on the GitHub pages plugin whitelist, so it would require
    a more complicated build.
