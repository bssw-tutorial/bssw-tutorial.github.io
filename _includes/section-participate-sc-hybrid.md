* We want to interact with you! We find these tutorials most interesting and informative (for everyone) if you ask questions and share experiences! We learn too!

* If you're in the room with us, please raise your hand to ask a question.  Please wait for the microphone so that others in the room as well as online participants can hear your question.

* If you're online, please use the Digital Experience Q&A tool to ask your question.  We'll respond verbally or in the Q&A tool or verbally as opportunities permit. Please remember that the online stream is delayed about 15 seconds, so there will be some latency in our responses.
