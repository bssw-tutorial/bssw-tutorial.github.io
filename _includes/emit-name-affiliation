  emit-name-affiliation: emit the name and affiliation from a person's record
    example: "firstname lastname (affiliations)"
    where there might be multiple affiliations

  arguments:
    `person`: record containing the person's information

  Expected elements of person structure
    lastname (string)
    firstname (string)
    affiliations (array)

  Notes: 
  * missing elements will be silently ignored
  * In the case where there is only a firstname or only a lastname and no affiliation
    an extra trailing space will be included. This is a corner case, not worth
    addressing until it becomes a problem

  FIXME: why do we have to specify element 0 here?
