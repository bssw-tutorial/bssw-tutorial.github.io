# A typical initial tutorial page might include:
#         [description,agenda,presentation-slides,requested-citation,acknowledgments-ecp]
# Note that agenda, presentation-slides, and requested-citation are okay here because they
# gracefully handle the absence of the information required to make those sections "event-ready".
#
# A typical complete tutorial page would include: 
#         [description,agenda,presentation-slides,participate*,hands-on-exercises,stay-in-touch,resources-from-presentations,requested-citation,acknowledgments-ecp]
# where `participate*` might be participate-inperson, participate-hybrid, or participate-online, as appropriate.  A custom local `section-participate.md` file will also work.
# Consider adding a related-events section if appropriate
